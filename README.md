# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice Skating - Cave Escape Puzzle

*An innovative puzzle game where players navigate through icy cave environments to find the exit. The game features slippery ice mechanics similar to classic Pok√©mon ice puzzles, combined with modern multiplayer capabilities and procedural map generation for endless gameplay.*

![Game Preview](extra/boot_splash.png)

## üéÆ Game Concept

*You find yourself trapped in an icy cave and must reach the exit by strategically using the environment. The core challenge lies in the slippery ice mechanics: once you start moving in a direction, you'll continue sliding until you hit a non-icy surface. Players must carefully plan their moves, avoid fragile ice that breaks after stepping on it, and navigate around deadly holes that end the game.*

## üîß Technical Challenges Overcome

### Server-Authoritative Multiplayer
*A robust anti-cheat system validates all game actions server-side while maintaining responsive gameplay through client prediction.*

### Procedural Map Generation
*A sophisticated C++ algorithm generates balanced, solvable cave layouts with appropriate difficulty scaling.*

### Client Prediction System
*A lag compensation system provides immediate visual feedback while ensuring server authority over game state.*
